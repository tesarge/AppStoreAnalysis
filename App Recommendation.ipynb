Sorry, iQiyi, we'll have to take you out of our data.\n",

We can check each character in the app name to see if its ASCII number is 127 or less. We should also consider other characters such as emojis or trademark logos that sometimes appear in app names. We can give apps a threshold for the number of non-English characters they cinlude before we consider it a non_english app. Below I've set it to three."

Paid apps, while also benefitting from a high volume of users, can rely on user payments in a variety of ways such as upfront app cost, a monthly subscription fee, or in-app upgrades, to name a few. In this way, paid apps can make decent revenue with fewer users than a free app. Our goal of having a high user count means that we should plan on launching the app on both the Google Play store and The App Store.\n",

More interestingly is that there is a high number of apps related to learning English, all likely with some competitive overlap, yet many of these apps have over 1 million installs. This has me thinking that we should look at the App Store data in the 'Education' genre."

    "Initially when I looked through the App Store data, I looked through the categories that had higher average ratings. AFter seeing the Google Play 'EDUCATION' category, it seemed like this might be a good genre for us to explore and despite having a lower average review count, the App Store data I feel supports this as well. If we comb through the App Store 'Education' genre we can see at the bottom that there are a handful of apps with less than 1000 reviews, but nearly all of them are aimed at babies and small children. At the top we have apps geared more for adult learners, and they have some outstanding review counts. \n",

Duolingo, for instance, is a popular language learning app that encourages users to maintain daily streaks for app use. Some users have logged thousands of days using that app. This kind of app is being downloaded onto phones to be kept for a very long time. "
